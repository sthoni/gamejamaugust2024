# TITEL

## Einleitung

### Game Summary Pitch

*Beispiel: Mass Flux is a tile based puzzle game about reducing or generally manipulating the shape of a mass of cell-blocks to navigate to a goal.*

### Inspiration

* Mario

### Player Experience

*Beispiel: In a single screen dungeon for each of the 15 levels, the player will solve a short but perhaps complex puzzle requiring planning and management. The player must learn and use their knowledge of the interactions between the player cells and various environmental items to understand how to pass through each level.*

### Genre

* Jump'n'Run

## Konzept

### Gameplay

*Beispiel: The player controls a mass of player cells, each with individual status, but moves as a collective. Individual cells may die or be created which influences the total shape of the mass. By navigating through each level, the player must strategically manipulate the shape of the mass to be able to pass around or through obstacles to reach the goal.*

### Interpretation Theme

* Figur verändert die Größe

### Hauptmechanik

* Wenn Figur läuft, wird die kleiner
* Wenn Figur spring, wird sie größer

## Art

### Interpretation Theme

* ???

### Design

*Beispiel: A very minimalistic approach will go into the design of the game, heavily relying on the severe contrast of the limited colors to provide detail. Though, the design still is clean and smooth in the sense that, the use of many shades of a color will not be as present to confront the retro style and pixel art.*

## Audio

### Music

*Beispiel: To add to the overall theme and vibe of the game, there will be minimalism incorporated into the music. Heavy use of reverb and effects to fill space within the few instruments. Bass and drums will generally constitute the majority of tracks with accompanying softer sounds. Mainly through synthesized sounds rather than acoustic will further suggest the retro style.*

### Sound Effects

*Beispiel: To add more flare and polish to the experience, a multitude of environmental sound effects will give weight and feedback to the player’s actions. Rather than foley, or otherwise realistic sounds, synthesized blips, bloops, and whooshes are used.*
